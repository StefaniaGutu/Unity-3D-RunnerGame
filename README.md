## Description
In this game, as the player progresses, they will encounter a dynamic and challenging environment. The objective is to collect coins to increase the score while successfully navigating around obstacles. The player's ability to dodge obstacles is influenced by the color of the diamond.

As the player collects more coins, the game's difficulty level gradually increases. This means that the speed of movement becomes directly proportional to the number of coins collected. The more coins the player gathers, the faster the game becomes, creating a more intense and challenging experience.

The player can switch to AI mode if it presses the I key and also it can switch back by pressing the same key.
